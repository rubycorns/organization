# rubycorn rorganization

Where we can put organizational information so that we don't spam the whole mailing list :)

Please open a new organizational topic as an issue. Ex: business cards, unicorn onesies, where to meet, who will bring cake (Malwine) etc...

Close it when done. You know the drill.
